<h2>Project Grading</h2>
For each of the projects, I will look for the following items for grading.
<menu>
<li> Clarity: Program should be well written and well documented.
<li> Organization: Program should be written in well defined modules
and interface (parameters) should be well defined.
<li> Format: Program should be clear and very readable.
<li> Correctness: Program should generate correct results.
<li> Robustness: Program should handle unexpected input properly.
<li> Simplicity: While achieving the above goals, the simpler the
program is, the better.
